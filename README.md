# ScreenOfNibel
Replace music in normal menus with "Light of Nibel".

Mod only for my private usage due to the copyright of the music. You can see [the sound source is not uploaded](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/ScreenOfNibel/blob/1165/src/main/resources/assets/screenofnibel/.gitignore) (But you do can add it by yourself).
